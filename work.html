		On Sculpture
		</p>

		<p>
		For me the sculpture is the ultimate art form. In it I&nbsp;find a necessary physical balance and also—and&nbsp;perhaps therefore inevitably—aesthetic balance. The sculpture depends on&nbsp;surrendering to&nbsp;nature’s laws; complex physical equilibrium gives way to aesthetic appreciation by somewhat ordered irregularities. For some years I have studied these irregularities. I&nbsp;have found some in art and I have found more in nature. As&nbsp;a student of the arts I have wondered what makes beauty in a simple irregular alignment or composition. What makes my eyes play with ease, makes me find not only beauty but also a long-awaited rest. I have been surprised to find these same alignments and compositions everywhere in&nbsp;nature. Nature’s core existence evolves around the search for equilibrium; her desire for balance gives way to ordered irregularities. Perhaps that is&nbsp;why nature is always beautiful and is&nbsp;never considered to be kitsch. I have tried to adopt these irregularities in my artistic representations and I have used them as a weapon when imitating natural phenomenons.

		Water is what I have spent most of my professional career studying and imitating. The complex equilibrium composing a river, waterfall or mist rising as water hits a water surface. The fluid dynamics consist of endless possibilities—infinite paths within the finite space of a turbulent flow. An insignificant looking turbulent flow containing infinity. Observing it, my  eyes play with ease and I rest. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Virginia Woolf portrayed this infinity almost one hundred years ago. Woolf writes of a view out of a window; a flow of people and cars through the streets of London and in it “no two people are ever alike”.  A sight which her imagination had invested with a rhythmical order, eased strain and restored unity to her mind. Of the flow she writes: 
		<br>
		<br>
		At this moment, as so often happens in London, there was a complete lull and suspension of&nbsp;traffic. Nothing came down the street; nobody passed. A single leaf detached itself from the plane tree at the end of the street, and in that pause and suspension fell. Somehow it  was like a signal falling, a&nbsp;signal pointing to a force in things which one had overlooked.  It&nbsp;seemed to point to a&nbsp;river, which flowed past, invisibly, round the corner, down the street, and took people and eddied them along, as&nbsp;the stream at Oxbridge had taken the undergraduate in his boat and the dead leaves. Now it was bringing from one side of the street to the other diagonally a girl in patent leather boots, and then a young man in a maroon overcoat; it was also bringing a taxi-cab; and it brought all three together at a point directly beneath my window; where the taxi stopped; and the girl and the young man stopped;  and they got into the taxi; and then the cab glided off as if it were swept on by the current elsewhere.

		Reading her words I feel the rhythmical order; and strain has been eased from my body. I&nbsp;have&nbsp;unity restored to my mind as when I&nbsp;have looked at&nbsp;leaves dancing with the wind or appreciated a&nbsp;beautiful painting. It is the search of a&nbsp;complex body for equilibrium, which gives rise to somewhat ordered irregularities, which gives rise to&nbsp;beauty. The nature of the sculpture is to combine  physical and aesthetic equilibrium, each complementing the other. With that being said I&nbsp;think the sculpture, if successfully composed, is destined to guide beauty to the heart of the beholder.
