			<i>"...the essential notion of eternity, whereas the duration of time extends by succession of before and after. The proportion of eternity to the whole duration of time is as the proportion of an indivisible point to a continuous surface, [...] a circle: a point taken on the circumference does not coincide with every other point; but the centre, lying away from the circumference, is directly opposite to every point on the circumference. [...] Whatever therefore is in any portion of time, co-exists with the eternal, as present to it, although in respect to another portion of time it be past or future. But nothing can co-exist in presence with the eternal otherwise than with the whole of it, because it has no successive duration."
			</i> From St Thomas Aquinas's Summa contra Gentiles.

			<a href="mainSequence.html" target="_blank">Main Sequence is named after the longest phase in the life of our Sun where matter in a gaseous state battles gravity resulting in a balance lasting for billions of years. A sequence of events in which outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers keeping the object in a hydrostatic equilibrium.
